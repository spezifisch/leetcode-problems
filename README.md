My attempts at some leetcode.com coding problems

## Repository Structure

The directory `name` corresponds to the problem reachable under `https://leetcode.com/problems/<name>/`.
For example to see the description of `jewels-and-stones` go to https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

My submitted and not always successful solutions are called `one.py`, `two.py`, etc.

Most of the solutions contain the result as a comment on the bottom of the file, for example:

```python
# Runtime: 96 ms, faster than 98.07% of Python3 online submissions for Array Partition I.
# Memory Usage: 15.2 MB, less than 5.20% of Python3 online submissions for Array Partition I.
```
